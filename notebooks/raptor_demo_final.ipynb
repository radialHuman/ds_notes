            "Answer:  STORM is a writing system designed to aid in the synthesis of topic outlines through retrieval and multi-perspective question asking. It operates by discovering diverse perspectives on a given topic, simulating conversations, gathering conversations from sources, refining outlines, and adding trusted sources. The system aims to address challenges at the pre-writing stage, specifically focusing on how to research a topic and create an outline before starting to write. STORM has shown significant improvements in organization and coverage in article creation, outperforming other baseline models. It follows a multi-stage approach involving generating questions, reading and asking experts, splitting queries, and searching for information to enhance the research capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).\n"

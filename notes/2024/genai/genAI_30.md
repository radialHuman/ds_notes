# [Generative AI Full Course â€“ Gemini Pro, OpenAI, Llama, Langchain, Pinecone, Vector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEsleV16qdo)

## 00:00:00 DAY 1: Introduction to Generative AI Community Course
### 00:23:45 DL basics
#### ANN
- Input layer, output layer, hidden layer
#### CNN
- Convolution layer
    - Feature extraction using various filters
    - Pooling
    - Flatten the layer
    - Fully connected layer
- Grid type data : image and video
#### RNN
- sequence based input
- A feedback loop in hidden layer which is connected to itself till a specific time stamp
#### RL
- Agent, environment, state, reward
#### GAN
- NN for generating data
- Component:
    - generator (NN) : synthetic data is created
    - discriminator (NN) : real and synthetic are compared
### 00:34:00
- ChatGPT, Bard, Llama 2
- Gen AI types:
    - gen image model (GAN)
        - Image to image gen
    - gen lnaguage model (Transformers)
        - text to text/image gen
        - but can now generate images too (DALL-E)
### 00:50:00 Timeline of GenAI
- RNN : short term memory, time state
- LSTM : 
    - cell state
    - both short and long
    - forget gate, i/p and o/p gate
    - seq to seq mapping
        - 1:1, n:1, 1:n, n:n
- GRU : Graded recurrent unit
    - hidden state
    - reset and update gate
- Disadvantage of the above 3 is that the length of i/p and o/p were fixed

### 01:00:30
- Seq to seq learning 2014 paper
    - encoder and decoder with context vector
    - not good for long sentences as i/p, losses context
### 01:10:00 Attention is all you need
- Encoder Architecture
    - Input embedding : 
    - Positional embedding : 
    - Multi head attention : 
    - Add and normalization : 
    - Feed F/W n/w
- Decoder Architecture
    - ...
- Faster than previous models as it takes in input in ||le unlike LSTM which was 1/1 in sequence

## [Install TorchCP Locally - Python Toolbox for Conformal Prediction on Deep Learning Models](https://youtu.be/kdLnlafHAMI)
Release date : Dec 30, 2024
### Idea #deep
- To make predictions of NN more reliable (conformal)

### Details
- uses metrics like
    - 'error rate': 0.05, 'average width': 0.2, 'coverage rate': 0.95

## [Docling vs MarkitDown vs Marker - PDF to MarkDown Tool Comparison](https://youtu.be/KqPR2NIekjI)
Release date : Dec 30, 2024  
### Idea
- Comparing Docling, Marker, and markitdown

### Details
- Docling : Needs pytorch, good with tables, and creates png images
- Marker : Needs pytorch, not good with multic olumn page, and created jpg images 
- Markitdown : not good witht ables
- nougat is also another tool, not int this comparision

## [Vector Database Search - Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW) Explained](https://youtu.be/77QH0Y2PYKg)
Release date : May 22, 2024 
### Idea #VDB
- HNSW

### Details
- Navie : query compared distance to every vector in DB
    - brute force
    - o(N) : slow
- NSW : is a graph of connected nodes
    - each doc's vector is connected to the nearest vector in an iterative way
    - while searching for a query
        - randomly compare query witha node
        - compare the distance
        - then move to a node which is cloest to the previous node
        - compre its disatnce with query and so on untill the closest one is found
    - TO make it even faster it uses skipped linked list to make a hierarchy
    - this way filtering of nodes happen even more faster and many unrelated nodes are skipped
    -

## [Vector Database: A Must-Know Guide](https://youtu.be/TPYBYSyDRH4)
Release date : Jul 24, 2024  
### Idea #VDB
- VDB captures context of image text or audio by making it store mathematical representations based on similarity

### Details
- Embedding : data representation
- storage format  :FAISS HDF5 , optimized for vectors
- vector indexing : fast searching by arranging them using well known algorithms
    - Aprox, Nearest neighbour, sacrifising accuracy a little bit
    - Product Quantization : comrpess vectors y quantizing, less accuracy for speed
- Distance metrics : cosine, eclidean
- Query engine :  query planning, caching, paralell processing
- Metadata for filtering 
- hybrid : vector search + key word matching
- For scaling : distributed architecture

## [Unlimited AI Agents running locally with Ollama & AnythingLLM](https://youtu.be/4UFrVvy7VlA)
Release date : May 10, 2024
### Idea
- Ollama models as agents

### Details
- ollama has quantized mdoels : compressed 1 being the most and 8 being the least
- agent is llm not only generates but uses tools depending on prompt and does a task
    - memory : long , short
    - planning : reflection, self critisim, cot, subgoal decompostion
    - action using tools
- AnythingLLM
    - ai agent and rag on local on all the os
    - has ollama inside too
    - uses lance DB as VDB locally
    - anything llm embedder as default
    - RAG : upload doc in ui, gives with citation
    - has func calling in Agent Configuration task
        - @agent before the prompt to use the tools

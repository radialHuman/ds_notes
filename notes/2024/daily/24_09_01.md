## [MLSecOps is Fundamental to Robust AISPM // Sean Morgan // MLOps Podcast #257](https://youtu.be/hUsuSst_K_M)
Release date : 30/08/24
### Idea
- security ascpect in life cycle

### Details
- Data set must not be poisoned
- api keys check for sensitive data leakage
- open source model check and source
    - no remote code enabled
    - source should be trusted not just the name
    - check out cves for servers like pytorch endpoint inference servers
    - HF will have some compromised models (look at the scan report and banner)
- Data source or framework can also be affected
    - binary artifact can be an issue
    - model signed in open source tools
    - pickle scan
    - model scan
    - grak llmguard for halucination
- copyright
- vigil llm
- Risks
    - ray UI messed it up
    - mlflow has cves too related to server endpoint 
- needs continuous patching
- scan containers from cloud vendors

## [Compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) | w/ Example Code](https://youtu.be/FLkUOkeMd5M)
Release date : 01/09/24
### Idea
- high cost, reduce size

### Details
- model compression
    - without compormising on performance, reduce size
    - on edge 
    - local, so no breach of privacy
- techniques
    - quantization : lower presicion of parameter values
        - post training : no trainign requried on foundation models not beyond 4 bit
        - quanitization aware training : 1 bit model, trainign si intensive
    - pruning : 
        - unstrcutred  : removing weights individually, make them 0 , needs specilized hardware, gives spare mul matrix
        - structred : removes a whole part of architecture like a layer or head etc, 
    - knowledge distillation
        - teacher : to reduce size
        - soft targets : using logits
        - synthetic data : like alpaca

## [GraphRAG: The Marriage of Knowledge Graphs and RAG: Emil Eifrem](https://youtu.be/knDDGYHnnSI)
Release date : 29/08/24
### Idea
- GraphRag is rag where knwoeldge graph is used in retrival part

### Details
- graph is visual and explicit comapred to embeddings and vectors
- explaniability
- governance
- process
    - get initial set of nodes which are relevant
    - traverse graph and find all context
    - get all related docuements 
    - then generate
- advantage
    - betetr accuracy
    - answers something simplae rag couldn
    - easier dev* if knowldge graph is avaialable
    - cache cna be visualized for bug finding
- Knowlegde graph construction
    - structred : easy to build
    - unstrcutred : not easy at all
    - mixed : most of the use cases have this
- Types
    - lexical #findoutmore
    - domain

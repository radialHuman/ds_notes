## [Making Vector Search Work With Complex Data](https://youtu.be/r2tn_AbyOic)
Release date : Dec 10, 2024
### Idea #VDB
- VDB in prod how to do it 
- compare VDBs from the 1st resoruce link below
- 

### Details
- Problems:
- metadata is disconnected from the embedding hence difficult to search for
- OCR :  image embedidng is difficult
- Infra becomes more complicated soon
- superlinked

## [Vector Databases Explained (vs traditional databases & alternatives)](https://youtu.be/TprMWe54kZE)
Release date : Dec 12, 2024
### Idea #VDB
- storing and searching in VDB 
- indexing in VDB

### Details
- Indexing
    - embddings based on semantic meaning are stored using Hierarchical navigabale small words (HNSW) indexing
- query is compared with the vecors indexed using Nearest enighbour
- Filtering like key word search can be used to make the search narrrower fast
- For fault tolerance
    - vectors are stored in nodes 
    - has backups
- Sharding
    - parallel retriving
- api and interface
- Evaluatyion   
    - queries per sec processed
    - latency 
    - addtion of data
    - metadata handelling
    - indexing method matching for usecase
    - api user friendly
    - scaling horizontal
    - pricing
- Implementaion
    - preprocessing options
    - quality of data
    - optmize query
    - apply metadata filrgin to speed up
    - distributed paraell computing
- Monitoring
    - throguhput
    - latency
- serverless VDB uses geometric partitioning for optimizing search

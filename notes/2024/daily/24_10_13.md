> how much of human information is captured by web in terms of percentage.

It's challenging to provide an exact percentage of human information captured by the web, as this would require a comprehensive measure of all human information and its digital representation. However, it's estimated that less than 60 percent of web traffic is human, with the rest being bots. As for the amount of human information available online, a significant portion is indeed captured, but much remains outside the digital realm. Please note that the web is a growing and evolving entity, and the percentage of human information it captures can change over time.

> but still give an estimate

based on the available data and considering the rapid growth of digital content, it's reasonable to estimate that around 30-40% of human information may be available on the web. However, this is a rough estimate and should be taken with caution, as the actual percentage may vary significantly depending on the specific type of information and the method used to calculate it.

> which aspect of humans is not available digitally, give an exhaustive list

It's difficult to provide an exhaustive list of aspects of human experiences that are not available digitally, as this would require a comprehensive understanding of every individual's experiences and the complete scope of human knowledge. However, here are some examples of human experiences that are typically not digitally available:

1. **Physical sensations**: These include feelings like touch, taste, and smell, which are difficult to replicate digitally.

2. **Emotional experiences**: While digital platforms can facilitate communication and expression of emotions, the full depth and nuance of emotional experiences are often not captured online.

3. **Personal thoughts and ideas**: These often remain internal and are not shared or documented online.

4. **Interpersonal relationships**: While digital tools can facilitate communication, they cannot fully replicate the complexities and subtleties of in-person relationships.

5. **Private moments**: Many personal experiences and memories are not shared or documented online, remaining part of a person's private life.

6. **Physical activities**: Many activities, such as sports, exercise, or artistic pursuits, may not have a direct digital counterpart.

7. **Cultural and local experiences**: Some unique cultural practices, local traditions, and community events may not be well-represented online.

8. **Historical knowledge**: There are countless stories, experiences, and pieces of information that have not been digitized or may not be accessible online due to various reasons.

9. **Subconscious experiences**: Dreams, intuition, and other subconscious experiences are not typically captured or shared digitally.

10. **Personal growth and development**: Inner transformation, self-awareness, and other aspects of personal growth may not be directly reflected online.

Please note that this list is not exhaustive, as human experiences are vast and diverse, and not all aspects can be captured digitally.

> give a list of some more, which are not in the previous list

1. **Inner feelings and emotions**: The subtle layers of feelings and emotions that individuals experience throughout their daily lives often go unnoticed and unrecorded.
2. **Personal values and beliefs**: People's core values and beliefs may not always be explicitly expressed or documented online.
3. **Physical health and well-being**: While there might be some digital records of medical history, many aspects of a person's physical health and well-being are not available online.
4. **Personal habits and routines**: Daily habits and routines that individuals develop over time are not typically documented or shared online.
5. **Unrealized ideas and projects**: Many ideas and projects that individuals conceive but never realize or implement are not available digitally.
6. **Personal challenges and struggles**: People often keep their personal struggles and challenges private, and they may not be represented online.
7. **Learning experiences**: While educational content may be available online, the unique learning experiences and insights gained by individuals throughout their lives are not always captured digitally.
8. **Casual conversations and interactions**: Many everyday conversations and interactions that occur in-person or through non-digital means are not documented online.
9. **Personal creativity**: The creative expressions and ideas that individuals develop in their minds or through non-digital means are not always shared or documented online.
10. **Personal dreams and aspirations**: People's dreams and aspirations may change over time, and they may not always be documented or shared online.

Please note that this list is not exhaustive, as human experiences are incredibly diverse and complex, and not all aspects can be captured digitally.

> What sort of thing is hard to digitize. Give an exhaustive list of more than 10.

1. **Emotional experiences**: Emotions are complex and multifaceted, making them difficult to quantify and digitize accurately.
2. **Physical sensations**: Sensations like touch, taste, and smell are challenging to replicate digitally due to their subjective and ephemeral nature.
3. **Artistic expressions**: Many forms of art, such as painting, sculpture, or dance, are difficult to digitize without losing some of their essence.
4. **Natural environments**: Capturing the beauty and complexity of natural environments in a digital format can be challenging, as digital representations often lack the depth and richness of the real-world experience.
5. **Human relationships**: The intricacies and nuances of human relationships can be difficult to represent digitally, as they often involve non-verbal cues, emotions, and personal connections.
6. **Cultural heritage**: Preserving and digitizing cultural heritage can be challenging due to the unique and context-dependent nature of cultural practices and traditions.
7. **Historical records**: Many historical records are not digitized, and even when they are, the process can be time-consuming and prone to errors or inaccuracies.
8. **Personal memories**: Memories are highly subjective and personal, making them difficult to digitize accurately.
9. **Intellectual property**: Protecting and managing intellectual property rights in a digital format can be challenging, as digital content is often easily replicable and distributable.
10. **Ethical considerations**: Balancing privacy, security, and accessibility in a digital format can be difficult, as different individuals and groups may have varying perspectives on what constitutes ethical behavior.
11. **Legal frameworks**: Adapting and applying legal frameworks to the digital world can be challenging, as existing laws may not adequately address the unique aspects of digital content and interactions.
12. **Psychological aspects**: Digitizing psychological aspects, such as thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes, can be challenging due to their subjective and often unconscious nature.
13. **Social dynamics**: Understanding and representing social dynamics, such as power relations, group behavior, and social norms, can be difficult in a digital format.
14. **Educational methodologies**: Adapting and digitizing educational methodologies can be challenging, as effective teaching and learning often involve personal connections, hands-on experiences, and dynamic interactions.
15. **Linguistic nuances**: Capturing and representing linguistic nuances, such as dialects, slang, and cultural references, can be difficult in a digital format.

Please note that this list is not exhaustive, as the process of digitization involves many complexities and challenges

## [Differential Transformer](https://youtu.be/n-n7-K_z8Mw)
Release date :  Oct 12, 2024 
### Idea
- fundamental transformer architecture change
- like noise cancelling headphones, which amplifies attention to the relevant context while canceling noise

### Details
- differential attention mechanism can be easily implemented with FlashAttention    
- In the future, we can develop efficient low-bit attention kernels due to the reduced magnitude of activation outliers.
- The differential attention mechanism is proposed to cancel
attention noise with differential denoising. Specifically, we partition the query and key vectors
into two groups and compute two separate softmax attention maps. Then the result of subtracting
these two maps is regarded as attention scores. The differential attention mechanism eliminates
attention noise, encouraging models to focus on critical information
-  For example,
the proposed method substantially outperforms Transformer in key information retrieval, hallucination
mitigation, and in-context learning. DIFF Transformer also reduces outliers in model activations,
which provides new opportunities for quantization. The findings establish DIFF Transformer as an
effective and distinctive foundation architecture for large language models

## [Stop Losing Context! How Late Chunking Can Enhance Your Retrieval Systems](https://youtu.be/Hj7PuK1bMZU)
Release date : Oct 11, 2024
### Idea
- Late chunking in long context embedding model
- embed the whole doc and then chukc to preserve the context like : it, the subject, etc

### Details
- contextual chucking is brute forced and uses llm to add context, which can be costly, instead dont lose the context between sentences by not seperating /chunking first but embedding first
- though this will need more space
- whiel selecting embeddings : max token (context windows) and emebdding dimansion (o/p lenght of embedded vector)
- In normal chcking irrespective of the chukcing sentenced length the embedding size remains the same. 
    - this can lead to small sentences being costly and long loosing context
- difference between colbert and late chukcing is
    - late inetraction  :colbert has no pooling of tokens hence occupies more space 
    - while in late pooling occurs so context and space both are saved
- This is possible only if the emdding context lenght is huge
- introduced by jina

LlamaParse, as mentioned in the search results, is a GenAI-native document parser that can handle complex document data for various use cases, including conversion from PDF to Markdown. It's part of the LlamaCloud platform, which is currently in private preview.

Another product that can be used to convert PDF to Markdown is the "PDF to Markdown" tool. It's a standalone tool designed specifically for this purpose.

Additionally, Aspose's Free PDF to MD Converter is another option. This tool is based on Aspose software products, which are widely used for programmatic processing of PDF and MD files.

Please note that while I can provide these suggestions based on the search results, I don't have the ability to compare or test these tools directly. I recommend trying out each option to see which one best fits your needs.

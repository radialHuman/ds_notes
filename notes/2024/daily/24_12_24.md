## [Knowledge Graph or Vector Databaseâ€¦ Which is Better?](https://youtu.be/6vG_amAshTk)
Release date :  Dec 23, 2024 
### Idea
- knowledge graph  is for entity relationships
- interconnected concepts
- simple rag doesn capture this relation

### Details
- creation of the graphs is resource intensive task
- llm can be sued to automate this task across unstructured text to get the relaitons
- also to maintain and update them
- graph rag by MS
- entity (nodes) relationship (path) and community (cluster)
- communities can be formed using  Leiden algorithm
- high level and low level concepts clusters
- pip install graphrag
- graphrag init --root <FOLDER>
- yaml file will need the llm provider key
- change embedding model and llm if required
- extracting relations is done using prompt (lengthy one)
- in the right format to be used to convert into grpah for neo4j
- now apply ledian algorithm to create clusters (community) and levels
- embed the nodes using node 2 vec
- various type of search global local and drift
1. Global Search: Uses the LLM Generated community reports from a specified level of the graph's community hierarchy as context data to generate response.
2. Local Search: Combines structured data from the knowledge graph with unstructured data from the input document(s) to augment the LLM context with relevant entity information.
3. Drift Search: Dynamic Reasoning and Inference with Flexible Traversal, an approach to local search queries by including community information in the search process, thus combining global and lcoal

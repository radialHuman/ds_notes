- To detect ai generated text

### Details
- Features
    - basic
    - safe
    - feedback
    - deep analysis
    - plagarism scan
- API to use via SDK
-

## [Fireside Interview with Daniel Han - Co-Founder Unsloth AI](https://youtu.be/z9f4bEgFZCg)
Release date : 
### Idea
- Interview with unsloth's maker
- make big llms and ml algortihms simple small and faster using math tricks
- 

### Details

## [A quick overview of Large Language Models](https://youtu.be/p6ChISVKuKU)
Release date : 
### Idea
- 

### Details
- Famous ones
    - Bert : base and large
    - OpenAI : GPT1,2,3,4
    - Gemini, Gemma
    - Llama
    - Mistral
- Parameters : coefficients to be fine tunied in LLMS ex : weights
- Tokens : sub words that are derived from user input using tokenizer
- Context length : how much info llms can handle at a time, less is faster and more accurate but only small inputs
    - since llms are staless small context window might lead to not understanding the context
    - long ones are expensive
- open : mistral, grok, llama
- closed : claude,  chatGPT, Gemini
- There are languague  specific llms like : crossiant llm, leo llm and qwen llm
- Domain specific : code llama, mdeitron, samantha

## [Easily Run LOCAL Open-Source LLMs for Free](https://youtu.be/C_a52c-1hm8)
Release date : 
### Idea
- lmstudio can be used to downlaod models from hugging face
- Becoming a great open source alternative to openAI gpt

### Details
- in v0.2, two models can be used simulteneously
- making benchmarking models easier
- shows models that are compatible with the local system
- gui interface to manipulate parameters

## [Chunking Strategies in RAG: Optimising Data for Advanced AI Responses](https://youtu.be/pIGRwMjhMaQ)
Release date : 08/03/24
### Idea
- Better chunking will lead to better embedding to better similarity to better o/p

### Details
- fixed size will break words in middle, loss of info
- if its based on seperators, it will still not be helpful as the sentences will be shorter
- recurssive overlap also gets the same issue
- Doc text splitting is based on content:
    - python
    - js
    - etc
- Sematic chunking
    - joining sentences based on smiliarity of their embeddings
- Agentic
    - Lev 1 : proportion based chunking (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06648.pdf)
        - LLM is used to find similarities instead of embedding 
    - lev 2 :

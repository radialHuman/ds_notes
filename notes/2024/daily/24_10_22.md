## [LightRAG: A More Efficient Solution than GraphRAG for RAG Systems?](https://youtu.be/oageL-1I0GE)
Release date :  Oct 21, 2024
### Idea
- chat with document
- knwold. graph + embedding based RAG

### Details
- issue with graph rag is expensive
- light rag is inexpensive
- its Open source in github
- paper : light RAG : simple and fast RAG
- RAG cons
    - since chunkcing is done and then embedding, context is lost
    - this was solved by GraphRAG which maintains relations between entities
    - but this makes a lot of api calls and making it an expensive setup

## [AI SQL Data Analyst](https://youtu.be/hwgoNmyCGhQ)
Release date :  Feb 28, 2025
### Idea #SQL
- text 2 sql

### Details
#### technical stuff
- tables metadata, schemaa, datatypes , column definition
- use of tables, business context
- integration with database 1/1 
    - sql connector and dialect
    - business context for which databse or table to be used
- not specialised model for text 2 sql
- normal llm works for them
- Challenge : resoning around context of the meteadata and domain specific terms
- challenge : answers with confidence even if incorrect
    - prompt fine tuning
    - persona
    - say dont know if you dont, dont make things up
    - do I have enough context to answer the question?
    - assumes and unpredictable
- Pre-check : Check if the requiremnts are there. if not then dont proceed. have a validator
    - may eb ask it to ask question about the jargons and capture those
    - whats not clear
    - what do you not know
    - ask if schema is clear
- Question break down, may be suing resnonign
- Challenge : even the documentation or definition might not be enough
    - becuase it assumes the person reading it might have abasic knowledge of the domain which a llm might not have
    - even assinigng personas might fall short
- How to make sure the coontexts are captured
    - needs tailor made solution
    - for prompt insturctions without ambiguity
- treat them like a intern who doesn know anything
#### Architecture:
- no rag or embedding because it needs maintences and updating
- matching query embedding with documentation might be difficult
- finding relevant schema and tables and columns is the main step
1. full context with table and db info and metadata and context is taken in with the query
2. this will give the relevant table and schema
3. this is then taken to another one, to get sql query
4. human eval, test dataset was difficult
5. use case based on difficulty and only allow those

- Challenge : complex queries is difficult because llm is lazy and wants to do it in a simple manner :D
- challenge : guardrails for agent loop hell and slect * or DROPs
- model upgrade, will break things, prompts might overfit
- resoning model might make accuracy better

# [HRM: The 27M Parameter AI Model That Kills GPT-4 and Claude | Infrastructure Engineers need to know](https://youtu.be/W_RooBdr-i8)
Release date : Jul 30, 2025 #hrm
## Idea
- HRM uses 99% less size and less trainign data
- Hierarchial resoning model

## Details
- has 2 modules
    - H and L : like brain for abstract planning and detailed execution

# [HRM 27M beats Opus 4](https://youtu.be/yVsjCycZ1UQ?list=TLPQMjYwODIwMjXbG5bI0qYCgQ)
Release date : Aug 20, 2025 #hrm
## Idea
- HRM are not foundsation model, they fundationally differ in architecture

## Details
- LLM/foundation model are limited now, and the performance when scaled is saturated
- hence alternate rnn absed architectures are seeing new innovations
- not transformer based

# [The Era of Hierarchical Reasoning Models](https://youtu.be/J49kXKlF6q8)
Release date :  Aug 21, 2025 
## Idea
- 

## Details
- single forward pass for resoning
- first takes input embedding
- then updates hidden states in both the l and h modules
- then the low level runs and then combiens with high level  
- high level then processes it and send it back to multiple low level seq
- when ti converges then the output is read
- avoids early convergence
- No back propagation through time
    - this cna be unstable : xplosion or disappearance
    - this is aovided by using 1 step gradient approximation : does update them all just the last few

## Resource
its mainly for better reasoning in small size with less data

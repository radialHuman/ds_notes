## [LCM: The Ultimate Evolution of AI? Large Concept Models](https://youtu.be/y1MG0BCf3UU)
Release date : Dec 14, 2024 
### Idea #LCM #TODO
- FB's problem of having multiple languages on its platform wanted an alternative to language understanding
- so they replaced language tokens with concepts to predict
- humans think in concepts level not word level while thinking of somehting
- LCM works on high level sematic representation

### Details
- SONAR (23/08/23) was choosen to train embedding space for reasoning architecture
- A concept will be represented by a single vector
- This way LCM is trained on multiple languaes and modalities at once
- This will also address quadratic relation between length of input and computation
    - becuase it will operate on sequences that are much shorter
    - like summarizing a sentence and then embedding it
    - this can be an issue where laguage and details are important and cant be reduced like in scientific papers
- Diffusion based LCM
    -

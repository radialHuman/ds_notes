When not to use

1. LLM
    - if it come be dont in a simple way do it
        - it understands language, not numbers
        - ask it to write a function to do some what complicated arithematic and get the output as a fixed number
        - pls no : duplciate finding, form filling, timeseries forcasting
    - Its expansive consider the load on gpus, electricity, water consumption
    - The more you calls you make the slower it becomes
    - mental offloading, will make you an addict
    - use simple code, they are fast, easy to maintian
2. Frameworks
    - There is nothing you can do using simple OOPs that these fancy frameworks claim
        - function calling function (Langchains chains or LCEL)
        - fancy if else (Langraphs nodes and edges)
        - fancy datastructure (ConversationBufferWindowMemory)
        - log monitoring (langsmith)
    - Eval is just asking one llm to examine another one  
        - RAGAS : just prompts
        - Deepeval : the same
3. RAG
    - it a search that has gone to gym
    - where the searching is the most critical peice and LLM is just the cherry on the top
    - Dont use it if you want verbatim
    - Dont use it if you want consistency
    - Has many moving parts, so if you know them then configure it
    - alternative : if your data is small, use it in context
    - if its not able to fit in the window
        - alter it so that the search is easy
            - faq : similarity match
            - metadata based searching
    - Vector database are for similairty which doesn mean realtion
        - use graphs if required
            - but be casreful, its difficult to build
    - concentrate on having a proper ground truth
        - and retrival metrics
4. Agents
    - i dont care what the user is asking, these are all the functions you can call
        - figure it out yourself
    - needs extensive testing, even after deployment
    - What if the user entry is such that it misunderstands and does something incorrect?
    - Does it have a memory? to understand the right context?
        - what if the memory is conflicting?
    - Can it plan well? whats the guarantee?
    - How many times does it use the tool?
        - do you see its logic?
    - How much latency does it add?
    - How many tokens it will generate?
    - How much will it cost, moetarily and environment wise
    solution : Agentic workflow
    - If there are bunch of well known steps which depends on "intelligence"
    - Its a fancy if else statement
    - if the user is asking this, use this function/tool
5. MCP
    - Its just a protocol or a way to call your tools from the server
    - its nothing fancy, or doesn have intelligence
    - is your smartphone smart becase it uses usb c vs usb b?
6. A2A
    - One agent is difficult to control let alone a bunch of them talking to each other

takeaway
    - dont use llm everywhere, the cost is huge.
    - find a simple way like we used to, you are engineers not api callers
    - dont go with the hype, understand the internal mechanism and then choose the right tool
    - dont outsoure your thinking capability
    - if you have been asked to use agent or llms, find out if it actually fits or you are just shoving it
    - trust me I have been in the scenario where because of the hype and pressure
        I have used some fancy new shiny toy and then when it broke spent anxiety filled nights, fixing it unsuccessfully
    - its new, its hyped, its black box-ish so ask
    - building is easy, testing will take the months.
